# 🍦 Icy Tales

This is my small project made with **React JS**.  
Here I tried to make a single page application where user can see products, blogs and also add products to cart.

- If no product is selected, cart will be empty.
- User can remove selected products anytime.
- Cart data is saved in local storage.
